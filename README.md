These are JavaScrpts sample pages using each concept i created one type of page
These are web pages I created to practice every concept in innotive method 


Here’s a quick description of the JavaScript concepts I practiced:

1. Event Handlers: Event handlers in JavaScript allow you to make a web page interactive by responding to user actions, such as clicks, mouse movements, or key presses. By using event listeners like addEventListener(), you can define functions that will run when a specific event occurs, making your applications responsive to user input.


2. Random Color Change on Click: This concept involves generating a random color each time a user clicks on a specific element, such as a button or a background. You might use functions like Math.random() to create random RGB or hex values, then apply them to the element’s style properties. This is a fun way to add dynamic styling effects and practice DOM manipulation.


3. Other Simple Concepts:

DOM Manipulation: Changing or adding HTML elements and styles directly through JavaScript, allowing you to update the web page content dynamically.

Variables and Data Types: Practicing with let, const, var, strings, numbers, and booleans, which form the foundation for managing data in JavaScript.

Functions: Defining reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, such as generating random numbers or responding to events.

Conditionals and Loops: Using if statements and loops like for or while to add logic to your code, such as checking conditions or repeating actions.
